🔍 I'm on a mission to turn **data chaos** into **insightful stories**.  
I build models that *don’t just predict* — they **understand**.  
From notebooks to pipelines, from spreadsheets to clusters — I love it all.

---

🛠️ **Tech Stack I Rock With:**
- 🐍 Python — my native tongue
- 🤖 Machine Learning — where logic meets magic
- 🔥 PySpark — because small data is boring
- 📊 Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and a lot of `aha!` moments

---

💭 **Currently working on:**
- Improving my ML intuition (one failed model at a time 😄)
- Exploring distributed data processing
- Reading research papers and occasionally understanding them 🧪

---

📊 **My daily mood swings:**

---

🎯 **Goals for 2025:**
- Contribute to open-source ML projects  
- Build ML pipelines that scale 🚀  
- Master PySpark like a wizard  
- Eat less RAM (looking at you, pandas 😅)

---

📬 Wanna collaborate or just nerd out about models?
Feel free to check out my repos — PRs and stars are always appreciated ⭐

---

🧠 **Fun fact:**  
Sometimes I name my ML models.  
Last one was “Modelus Maximus” — it barely worked, but sounded cool.

Thanks for dropping by! Keep learning and keep breaking things (intentionally, of course). 😄
